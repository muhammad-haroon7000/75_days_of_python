# 75 Days of Python

This repository documents my journey of learning Python over 75 days. It's designed to be a helpful resource for other beginners who are starting their Python learning adventure.

## What's Inside

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) and some text files (`.txt`) covering various Python topics, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming (OOP). Each day focuses on specific concepts, making it easy to follow along.

Here's a breakdown of the topics covered so far:

- **Day 01:** Declaring Variables
- **Day 02:** Operators
- **Day 03 & 04:** Conditional Statements and Loops
- **Day 05:** Lists (including slicing)
- **Day 06:** Tuples
- **Day 07:** Sets
- **Day 08:** Dictionaries
- **Day 09:** Functions
- **Day 10:** Lambda Functions
- **Day 11:** Modules
- **Day 12:** File Operations
- **Day 13:** Exception Handling
- **Day 14:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals
- **Day 15:** Inheritance
- **Day 16:** Polymorphism
- **Day 17:** Encapsulation
- **Day 18:** Abstraction

(This list will be updated as I progress through the 75 days.)

## Why I Created This Repository

I created this repository to document my own learning process and to share what I've learned with others. I believe that learning is more effective when you share your knowledge and help others along the way. I hope this repository can be a useful resource for anyone starting their Python journey.
